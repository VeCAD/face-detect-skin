# Face Detection C++ code

Face detection C++ code related to my Master's thesis (refer to my Linkedin profile page for thesis) and to a certain extent the paper here:

<cite> Dharan, S. V., Khalil-Hani, M., & Shaikh-Husin, N. (2015, December). Hardware acceleration of a face detection system on FPGA. In 2015 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development (SCOReD) (pp. 283-288). IEEE. </cite>

Connected component labeling based off work here:

<cite>Tang, J. W., Shaikh-Husin, N., Sheikh, U. U., & Marsono, M. N. (2018). A linked list run-length-based single-pass connected component analysis for real-time embedded hardware. Journal of Real-Time Image Processing, 15(1), 197-215.</cite>

Won't run as is, please make sure OpenCV is installed correctly for compilation. Refer to function.hpp on how files are read/written, ary.hpp on image array allocation/deallocation, and face_detect_gauss.cpp for main function.
